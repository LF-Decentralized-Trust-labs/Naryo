## Broadcaster Spring Rabbit Configuration

To use a Rabbit broker as a broadcaster in a Naryo server, first add the required dependencies to your build,
then configure the Rabbit connection.

### 1) Add the module

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle` file with desired version:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.naryo:broadcaster-spring-rabbit:<version>'
}
```

### 2) Configure Spring to connect to Rabbit

Add the following to your application.yaml:

```yaml
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: {host} # e.g. localhost
    port: {port} # e.g. 5672
    username: {username} # e.g. guest
    password: {password} # e.g. guest
```

## Broadcaster Configuration

To use Rabbit as a broadcaster, a Broadcaster Configuration shall be configured with `type=rabbitmq`.

To define the exchange and routing key to be used, make use of the configured Broadcaster's `target` property.
