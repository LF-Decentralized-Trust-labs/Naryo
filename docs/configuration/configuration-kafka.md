## Broadcaster Spring Kafka Configuration

To use a Kafka broker as a broadcaster in a Naryo server, first add the required dependencies to your build,
then configure the Kafka connection.

### 1) Add the module

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle` file with desired version:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.naryo:broadcaster-spring-kafka:<version>'
}
```

### 2) Configure Spring to connect to Kafka

Add the following to your application.yaml:

```yaml
spring:
  kafka:
    producer:
      bootstrap-servers: {host}:{port}  # e.g. localhost:9092
    # Additional Kafka-specific configurations can be added here
```

## ðŸ“¡ Broadcaster Configuration

To use Kafka as a broadcaster, a Broadcaster Configuration shall be configured with `type=kafka`.

To define the topic to be used, make use of the configured Broadcaster's `target` property.
